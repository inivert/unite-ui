Welcome to [**unite-ui**](https://unite-ui.com), a community-driven project for [Vue](https://vuejs.org)!

This collection offers beautifully designed, reusable components, taking inspiration from the amazing work done on both [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com) and [Magic UI](https://magicui.design). While we're not officially affiliated with these projects, we have received permission from Aceternity UI's creator to adapt those fantastic designs for the Vue ecosystem. Additionally, unite-ui includes custom components developed by us and contributed by the community.

### About unite-ui

unite-ui is **not** a traditional component library. Instead, it's a curated collection of elegant components you can easily integrate into your applications. Simply pick what you need, copy the code, and customize it to fit your project. The code is yours to use and modify as you like!

### Why unite-ui?

### About Me

Hi, I'm [Carlos](https://github.com/inivert). I created unite-ui to provide the Vue community with a comprehensive collection of beautiful, functional components that are easy to integrate and customize. Building on the foundations laid by projects like Inspira UI, Aceternity UI, and Magic UI, I've focused on creating a library that emphasizes developer experience and design flexibility. I'm committed to maintaining and expanding this project with the help of the community. You can follow my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/inivert) and join this journey by contributing to [unite-ui](https://github.com/inivert/unite-ui)!

Feel free to explore and enjoy building with unite-ui!
